## Setup
You can check some relevant info at https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react-template

To set up a project, the best way is using the CRA for **skeleton** template, with:
```
npx create-react-app my-app --template @carto
cd my-app
yarn start
```

As a help it might be useful to have a local working copy of the **sample-app**, to review & debug code from it. So you might also want to execute once:
```
npx create-react-app my-sample-app --template @carto/sample-app
```

## Recommended environment
- VS Code
- chrome latest
- 2 chrome extensions: React Developer Tools / Redux DevTools
